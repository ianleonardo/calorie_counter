# Calorie Counter
Build simple web to estimate Calories based on the uploaded image

# Prepare Environment
Create: python -m venv venv
Activate: source venv/bin/activate (Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Win)
Install: pip install -r requirements.txt

Method A: The .env File (Recommended for Local Dev)
This is the easiest way. You create a file that acts like a fake OS environment.

Create a new file in your project folder named .env (just .env, no name before the dot).

Open it and paste your key like this:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...YourKeyHere...

Important: Add .env to your .gitignore file so you don't accidentally upload this file to GitHub!
